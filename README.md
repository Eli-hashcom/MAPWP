# MacOS Appearnace Program & Wallpaper Program (MAPWP)
MAPWP is an application on MacOS that presents a way to change the background based of the appearance.

## Supported devices
This application may or may not be usable on older devices, such as intel macbooks. I am pretty sure that Macbooks with the Apple Silicon chip works perfectly fine with MAPWP!

## Flaws
- backgrounds can not be selected yet as I have select the ones I wanted as the backgrounds
- MAPWP may be unstable

## Lend a hand
if you find any bugs or just want to give a helping hand. Then you can support me by giving a star on this project.
